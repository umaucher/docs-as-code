   :partially_verifies_list: tool_req__docs_common_attr_id_scheme
   :test_type: requirements_based
   :derivation_technique: requirements_based

   Tests if the id format is followed.
   3 Part needs, need to follow different conventions than 2 part or undefined part needs


.. Id does not consists of 3 parts

.. stkh_req:: This is a test
   :id: stkh_req__test
   :expect: stkh_req__test.id (stkh_req__test): expected to consist of this format: `<Req Type>__<Abbreviations>__<Architectural Element>`.


.. Id consists of 3 parts

.. stkh_req:: This is a test
   :id: stkh_req__test__abcd
   :expect_not: expected to consist of this format


.. Id follows pattern

.. stkh_req:: This is a test
   :id: stkh_req__test__test__abcd
   :expect: stkh_req__test__test__abcd.id (stkh_req__test__test__abcd): expected to consist of this format: `<Req Type>__<Abbreviations>__<Architectural Element>`.


.. Id starts with wp and number of parts is 3

.. workproduct:: This is a test
   :id: wp__test__abcd
   :expect: wp__test__abcd.id (wp__test__abcd): expected to consist of this format: `<Req Type>__<Abbreviations>`.


.. Id is invalid, because it starts with wp and contains 2 parts

.. workproduct:: This is a test
   :id: wp__test
   :expect_not: expected to consist of this format
