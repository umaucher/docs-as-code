   Tests if we correctly enforce mandatory options & links for workproducts


.. std_wp:: Standard work product
   :id: std_wp__iso26262__001

.. std_req:: Standard requirement
   :id: std_req__iso26262__001

.. std_req:: Standard IIC requirement
   :id: std_req__aspice_40__iic_001

.. Expect no warning with "complies"

.. workproduct:: No Link is ok, since complies is optional
   :id: wp__001
   :expect_not: complies

.. Expect no warning with "complies"

.. workproduct:: Linking to std_wp is allowed
   :id: wp__002
   :complies: std_wp__iso26262__001
   :expect_not: complies

.. FIXME: this will currently be printed as an INFO, and not as a warning.
   Re-enable EXCPECT once we can enable that as a warning.

.. workproduct:: Cannot refer to std_req element
   :id: wp__003
   :complies: std_req__iso26262__001
   :expect: std_req__iso26262__001` does not fulfill condition `{'or': ['id contains aspice_40__iic', 'id contains std_wp']}`. Explanation: Workproducts may only link to ASPICE 40 IIC stakeholder requirements. Please ensure that the linked requirement is an ASPICE 40 IIC stakeholder requirement.

.. workproduct:: But it can refer to std_req if it is an IIC requirement
