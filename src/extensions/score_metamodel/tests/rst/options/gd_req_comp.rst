   Tests if metamodel link options are correclty checked



.. std_req:: Standard requirement
   :id: std_req__iso26262__001

.. Expect to warning with "complies"

.. gd_req:: No Link is ok, since complies is optional
   :id: gd_req__001
   :expect_not: complies



.. FIXME: this will currently be printed as an INFO, and not as a warning.
      Re-enable EXCPECT once we can enable that as a warning.

.. .. gd_req: Cannot refer to non std_req element
..    :id: gd_req__003
..    :complies: gd_req__001
..    :expect:  gd_req__003: references 'gd_req__001' as 'complies', but it must reference Standard Requirement (std_req).
