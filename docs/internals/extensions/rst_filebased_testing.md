# File based rule checks

## Test Function
The functionality of the Sphinx build rules can be verified with test rst files.

The function *test_rst_files* in *test_rules_file_based.py* is executed for
each rst file in the directory *rst*.
It creates a SphinxTestApp and a document source folder with an index.rst file
that contains a toctree with the given rst file.

It uses the SphinxTestApp to build the documentation and checks for the
**expected/not expected** warnings.

**It has it's OWN conf.py, so if changes need to be made ensure they are made in there**

## Create a test rst file
To add a new test case either create a new rst file in the rst directory,
or add it to an existing one if it tests something similar
The test files can also be organized in a subfolder structure below directory rst.

Each test file consists of two parts:

1. Exactly **one** `test_metadata` need at the top of the file. It declares which
   check(s) to run and links the test to the requirements it verifies.
2. One or more Sphinx-Needs directives. A need that should (or should not) emit a
   warning carries an `:expect:` / `:expect_not:` option describing that warning.

### The `test_metadata` need

`test_metadata` is now a real Sphinx-Needs directive (not a comment). There must
be exactly one per file:

.. code-block:: rst

    .. test_metadata::
       :id: test_metadata__<unique_name>
       :partially_verifies_list: <requirement id(s)>
       :test_type: requirements_based
       :derivation_technique: requirements_based

       <description of what this file tests>

**\<check functions>**
All checks are run in each rst test file to ensure no contradiction and make testing easier / more complete

**\<requirement id(s)>**`:partially_verifies_list:` / `:fully_verifies_list:`<br>
The requirement(s) this test verifies. At least one of `:partially_verifies_list:`
or `:fully_verifies_list:` must be provided, otherwise the test fails.

**`:test_type:` / `:derivation_technique:`**<br>
Describe how the test was derived. They are attached as properties to the test
result.

### Needs with expectations

The `:expect:` / `:expect_not:` options live **on the need that is being tested**.
There is no separate statement and no `[+x]` line offset anymore &mdash; the warning is
matched against the need's own location.

**\<warning message>** &mdash; `:expect:` / `:expect_not:`<br>
Message text which is expected / not expected during the Sphinx build for this
need. You only need to match a unique substring, not the full message.

A need **without** `:expect:` or `:expect_not:` is treated as a setup /
prerequisite need (for example a link target) and is not asserted against.

**Example:**

.. code-block:: rst

    .. test_metadata::
       :id: test_metadata__mandatory_options
       :partially_verifies_list: tool_req__docs__status
       :test_type: requirements_based
       :derivation_technique: requirements_based

       Tests that mandatory options are enforced.

    .. std_wp:: Test requirement
       :id: std_wp__test__abcd
       :expect: std_wp__test__abcd: is missing required attribute: `status`.

This example verifies that the warning message
*std_wp__test__abcd: is missing required attribute: \`status\`* is shown during
the Sphinx build.

**Expect-not example:**

    .. std_wp:: Test requirement
       :id: std_wp__test_options__abce
       :status: active
       :expect_not: attribute

Here the need is fully valid, so we assert that no warning containing the
substring *attribute* is emitted for it.

> **Note:** RST comments used to separate or describe cases (for example
> `.. All required options are present`) must not contain `::`, otherwise the
> parser counts them as needs.

### Warning message format

You only need to match a unique substring, not the full message. For example:

    :expect: wp__bad: Parent need `std_req__aspice_40__bp`

.. hint::

   For `:expect:` use as much as possible of the error message, however for `:expect_not:` use as little as possible
   to catch all other issues that MIGHT occur and to avoid for typos etc.

### Setup needs

Prerequisite needs (link targets, shared fixtures) carry no `:expect:` /
`:expect_not:` option. The framework only asserts on needs that have one of these
options, so unannotated needs are invisible to the assertion logic.

### The "exempt" case

A need that does not meet the `condition:` in the YAML check definition is not
selected by the check at all &mdash; no warning is emitted. Test this with
`:expect_not:`:

.. code-block:: rst

    .. workproduct:: No link at all
       :id: wp__no_link
       :expect_not: <something from the explanation>

### Full example (graph check)

.. code-block:: rst

    .. test_metadata::
       :id: test_metadata__graph_aspice_40
       :partially_verifies_list: gd_req__aspice_40__parent_link
       :test_type: requirements_based
       :derivation_technique: requirements_based

       Verifies the ASPICE 40 IIC parent-link graph check.

    .. std_req:: ASPICE 40 IIC requirement
       :id: std_req__aspice_40__iic_1
       :status: valid

    .. std_req:: ASPICE 40 non-IIC requirement
       :id: std_req__aspice_40__bp_1
       :status: valid

    .. Positive: links to allowed target — no warning.

    .. workproduct:: Valid workproduct
       :id: wp__valid
       :complies: std_req__aspice_40__iic_1
       :expect_not: ASPICE 40 IIC

    .. Exempt: no complies link — condition not met, check skipped.

    .. workproduct:: Workproduct without link
       :id: wp__no_link
       :expect_not: ASPICE 40 IIC

    .. Negative: links to disallowed target — warning expected.

    .. workproduct:: Invalid workproduct
       :id: wp__bad
       :complies: std_req__aspice_40__bp_1
       :expect: wp__bad: Parent need `std_req__aspice_40__bp_1`
