📈 Status
##########

This section provides an overview of current process requirements and their clarification & implementation status.

.. note::
  All open issues and pull requests in the process repository are considered as if they
  are already part of the process requirements. They address a lot of the
  requirements that are referenced in this document, so we would be blocked if we would
  not consider them as part of the process requirements.

🗂️ Common Attributes
#####################

.. note::
  To stay consistent with sphinx-needs (the tool behind docs-as-code), we'll use `need`
  for any kind of model element like a requirement, an architecture element or a
  feature description.


----------------------
🔢 ID
----------------------

.. tool_req:: Enforces need ID uniqueness
  :id: tool_req__docs_common_attr_id
  :implemented: YES
  :tags: Common Attributes
  :version: 1
  :satisfies:
     gd_req__req_attr_uid,
     gd_req__tool_attr_uid,
     gd_req__arch_attribute_uid,
     gd_req__saf_attr_uid,
  :parent_covered: NO

  Docs-as-Code shall enforce that all Need IDs are globally unique across all included
  documentation instances.

  .. note::
     Within each docs-instance (as managed by sphinx-needs), IDs are guaranteed to be unique.
     When linking across instances, unique prefixes are automatically applied to maintain global uniqueness.

.. tool_req:: Enforces need ID scheme
  :id: tool_req__docs_common_attr_id_scheme
  :implemented: YES
  :tags: Common Attributes
  :version: 1
  :satisfies:

    gd_req__impl_unit_uid,
    gd_req__impl_interface_uid,
  :parent_covered: NO: cannot check non-existent "doc__naming_conventions" in gd_req__req_attr_uid

  Enforce that Need IDs follow the following naming scheme:

  * A prefix indicating the need type (e.g. `feature__`)
  * A middle part matching the hierarchical structure of the need:
     * For requirements: a portion of the feature tree or a component acronym
     * For architecture elements: the structural element (e.g. a part of the feature tree, component acronym)
     * For safety analysis (FMEA, DFA): name of analyzed structural element (e.g. Persistency, FEO, etc.)
  * Additional descriptive text to ensure human readability


----------------------

  :parent_covered: YES

  Docs-as-Code shall enforce that requirement descriptions do not contain the following weak words:
  ju-st, ab-out, rea-lly, so-me, th-ing, absol-utely

  This rule applies to:

  * all requirement types defined in :need:`tool_req__docs_req_types`, except process requirements.

  .. note::
    Artificial "-" added to avoid triggering violation of this requirment in this document.

  :tags: Requirements
  :implemented: YES
  :version: 1
  :satisfies: gd_req__req_attr_type

  Docs-as-Code shall enforce that each need of type :need:`tool_req__docs_req_types`
  except process and tool requirements has a ``reqtype`` attribute with one of the
  following values:

  :id: tool_req__docs_req_attr_reqcov
  :tags: Requirements
  :implemented: PARTIAL

  Docs as code shall shall enable marking requirements as covered by their linked children.

  Attribute ``reqcov`` must be one of the following values:
      * Yes
      * No

  .. note::
     No concept yet, as parents are generally not aware of their children.

  :implemented: PARTIAL
  :version: 1
  :parent_covered: YES

  :status: invalid

  Docs-As-Code shall allow for every need of type :need:`tool_req__docs_req_types` to
  have a ``testcovered`` attribute, which must be one of:

    gd_req__req_attr_valid_until[version==1],
  :status: valid

  Docs-as-Code shall enforce that the ``valid_from`` and ``valid_until`` attributes of stakeholder and feature requirements are correct.

  The format of a milestone is something like "v0.5" or "v1.0.1".
  No suffixes like "-SNAPSHOT" or "-beta" are allowed.

.. tool_req:: Enforce validity start is before end

  :parent_covered: YES
  :satisfies: gd_req__req_validity[version==1]
  :status: valid

  Docs-as-Code shall enforce that ``valid_from`` is before ``valid_until`` attribute in stakeholder and feature requirements.
  We consider "from" is inclusive but "until" is exclusive, so from v0.5 until v1.0 means valid for v0.5 but not for v1.0.
  If either attribute is missing, no check is performed.
